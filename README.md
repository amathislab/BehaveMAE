## ✨ Highlights

### 🔥 Hierarchical Action Segmentation (HAS) Benchmarks
Recognizing the scarcity of large-scale hierarchical behavioral benchmarks, we create a novel synthetic basketball playing benchmark (Shot7M2). Beyond synthetic data, we extend BABEL into a hierarchical action segmentation benchmark (hBABEL).

### ⚡️ A Generalized and Hierarchical Masked Autoencoder Framework

We developed a masked autoencoder framework (hBehaveMAE) to elucidate the hierarchical nature of motion capture data in an unsupervised fashion. We find that hBehaveMAE learns interpretable latents, where lower encoder levels show a superior ability to represent fine-grained movements, while higher encoder levels capture complex actions and activities.


## 🔨 Installation

We developed and tested our models with `python=3.9.15`, `pytorch=2.0.1`, and `cuda=11.7`. Other versions may also be suitable.
The easiest way to set up the environment is by using the provided `environment.yml` file:

  ```bash
  conda env create -f environment.yml
  conda activate behavemae
  ```

## ➡️ Data Preparation

For downloading and preparing the three benchmarks Shot7M2 ([download here 🏀](https://huggingface.co/datasets/amathislab/SHOT7M2)), hBABEL, and MABe22 we compiled detailed instructions in the [datasets README](datasets/README.md).


## 🔄 Pre-training (code)

To pre-train a model on 2 GPUs:
```
bash scripts/shot7m2/train_hBehaveMAE.sh 2
```

## ⤴️ Inference
To extract hierarchical embeddings after training and evaluate these embeddings:
```
bash scripts/shot7m2/test_hBehaveMAE.sh
```

## 🦁 Model Zoo

We provide a collection of pre-trained models on [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/13790191) that were reported in our paper, allowing you to reproduce our results:
